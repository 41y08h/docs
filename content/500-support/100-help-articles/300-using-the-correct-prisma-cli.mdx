## Problem

Lots of users have faced this issue that whenever they run `npx prisma generate` or a Migrate command like `npx prisma migrate dev --preview-feature`, the following message is shown:

```
can't find prisma.yml file
```

`prisma.yml` is specific to Prisma 1. This happens because `npx` cannot find the Prisma 2 CLI locally and tries to fetch it from NPM which brings the Prisma 1 CLI (this issue will be solved soon).

## Solution

The best and recommended approach is to install `@prisma/cli` locally in your project. This will make sure that `npx` uses the local CLI that is specific to Prisma 2. This will also make sure that your `@prisma/cli` version is consistent and you wouldn't get any unexpected results.

On top of this, you could also add this to your `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prisma": "prisma"
}
```

On adding this, you can directly run `yarn prisma` or `npm run prisma` to work with the installed version of Prisma.

For e.g. if you would want to generate `PrismaClient`, you could simply run:

```
yarn prisma generate
```

or

```
npm run prisma -- generate
```

The same will work for all commands that Prisma offers like Migrate.

So this is how you could prevent any issues with different versions of the Prisma CLI.
