To upgrade to the latest version of Prisma:

1. Review [release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases) on GitHub for breaking changes and new features.
1. Upgrade **both** of the following packages to the same version:
    
    * [`prisma`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma)
    * [`@prisma/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client)

> **Tip**: [codemods](codemods) help you refactor your code to account for breaking changes - for example, the 2.12.0 codemod automatically renames `findOne` to `findUnique`.

## Enabling preview features

* [Prisma Client preview features](../../../concepts/components/preview-features/client-preview-features)
* [Prisma CLI preview features](../../../concepts/components/preview-features/cli-preview-features)

## <inlinecode>dev</inlinecode> branch

The `dev` branch contains in-progress code / verify fixes.


* Do not use the `dev` branch in production

```terminal
npm install prisma@dev --save-dev
```

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client@dev --save-dev
```

but maybe a small blurb about the dev -> latest promotion would also be helpful?


## <inlinecode>@prisma/cli</inlinecode> renamed to <inlinecode>prisma</inlinecode>

The `@prisma/cli` package was renamed to `prisma` in 2.20.0.
