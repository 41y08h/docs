<TopBlock>

A Prisma schema can have one or more generators, represented by the [`generator`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generator) <span class="api"></span> block:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/prisma-client-js"
}
```

A generator determines which assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. The main property `provider` defines which **Prisma client (language specific)** is created, currently only `prisma-client-js` is available. Alterantively you can define any Npm package that follows our generator specification. Additionally and optionally you can define a custom output folder for the generated assets with `output`.

## `prisma-client-js`

The generator for Prisma's Javascript Client accepts multiple additional properties:

- `binaryTargets`: Target **engine binaries** for `prisma-client-js` (for example, `debian-openssl-1.0.x` if you are deploying to Ubuntu 14.04, or `native` if you are working locally)
- `previewFeatures`: Preview features to include

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets   = ["linux-msl"]
  previewFeatures = ["sample-preview-feature"]
}
```

### Binary targets

Prisma Client JS (`prisma-client-js`) uses several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). Engines are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_. Depending on which platform you are executing your code on, you need the correct binary.

The correct binary file is particularly important when [deploying](../../../guides/deployment/deployment) your application to production.

#### The `native` binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the [list of supported operating systems](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options) <span class="api"></span>. As you're running Mac OS, the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.
